The primary objective of exploratory data analysis is to uncover the underlying sructures. It helps to identify obvious errors, 
outliers as well as provides a better understanding of patterns and relationships between variables.
In this project it is important to understand how variables may be related to billed medical expenses. 
For example,one could expect that smokers and older people are at higher risk of large medical expenses. 
In this section, I will explore possible relationships between various features and cost through data visualization.

'''

# Charges vs count
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.title('Total Cost Distribution')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.xlabel('Charges($)')
sns.histplot(df.charges, fill=False, kde=True)

'''

Insight
The mean value is greater than the median which implies that the distibution of insurance charges is skewed to the right which I can confirm using a histogram.
However, a large majority of individuals have a total yearly medical expenses between zero and $15,00.

'''

# Count vs Charges of Smokers and non-Smokers
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title('Cost Distribution Smokers and Non-Smokers')
plt.xlabel('Density')
plt.ylabel('Charges($)')
sns.histplot(x=df.charges, hue=df.smoker, element='step')

'''

Insights
It appears that there are more non-smokers than smokers and when compared to each other smokers have higher medical expenses.
The large majority of non-smokers recieve less than 15k while majority of smokers recieve bills greater than 15K

'''
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))
sns.relplot(x='charges', y='age', col='smoker', data=df)

'''

Insights
It appears that there are more non-smokers than smokers and when compared to each other smokers have higher medical expenses.
The large majority of non-smokers recieve less than 15k while majority of smokers recieve bills greater than 15K

'''

# AGE
plt.figure(figsize=(10 ,6))
sns.histplot(x=df.age, hue=df.smoker)

'''
Insights
This is a closer look at the age of participants and their smoking habits.
It appears that the largest portion of this data was collected from indiviuals in their early 20's.
The age range of participants are 18 years old to 64 years old.

'''

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))
sns.relplot(x='age', y='charges', col='sex', hue='smoker', data=df)

'''
Insights
When comparing medical expenses gender does seem to be a determinante of price in this study.

'''
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
ax = sns.countplot(x=df.sex, hue=df.smoker)

for i in ax.containers:
    ax.bar_label(i, label_type='edge', padding=1)
ax.margins(y=0.1)
'''

Insights
Gender does not seem to correlate with higher rates of smoking in this study.

'''
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))
sns.pairplot(df, hue='smoker')
'''

'''
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.distplot(df.bmi)
'''
Insights
There is a normal distibultion curve for BMI in participates in this study.

'''
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lmplot(x="bmi", y="charges", hue='smoker', data=df, size=8)
'''
Insights
BMI seems to have a larger impact on medical expences in those who smoke vs those who do not.
